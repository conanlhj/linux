The Welsh language has survived centuries of British colonial rule and now enjoys a privileged status of an official language along with English in Wales. In spite of the compulsory education of the language in Wales, the number of Welsh speakers has decreased, and the dominance of English language in almost every aspect of Welsh life is threatening the fate of Welsh. This paper examines the fate of Welsh in English poems of Gwyneth Lewis, a bilingual poet. Unlike her predecessors who regarded writing in English as a kind of betrayal to Welshness, she skillfully crosses the barrier between the two languages. She declares the death of Welsh and even confesses herself to be her murderer. While lamenting the loss of Welsh cultural heritage is apparently the topic of her poems, Lewis leads the readers to doubt the death of her mother tongue through inserting Welsh words and utilizing Welsh prosody in her English poems. She is concerned about the fate of the Welsh language as a part of her poetic heritage and assets which include other languages than her mother tongue.
