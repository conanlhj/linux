This research investigated the effectiveness of machine translators as learning tools by conducting a study using two writing processes involving 17 university freshmen, and their perceptions regarding it. This was done over 15 weeks during a fall semester in 2018 as part of their descriptive writing in the Essential English course. With the guidance of the researchers, the students used two methods when translating their Korean compositions into English. These compositions covered four topics and included 1,548 sentences. One method involved translation with the use of dictionaries first, then machine translators. The other utilized machine translators directly. The results of the paired t-test that covered both methods was p=0.017 (p<0.05). It showed that a longer translation process is not helpful in yielding a more accurate result. Furthermore, a survey showed that the use of a machine translator led to the students experiencing an improvement in their writing skills, with 76.5% of the respondents agreeing positively. However, only 29.4% of students were convinced that machine translators were reliable. These findings suggest that the students need to develop their English skills and level of intuition through further study in order for them to properly benefit from the use of machine translators
