For the purpose, a production experiment was carried out, in which recordings were done by three Gwangju and three Seoul speakers in their 20â€™s who were born and grew up at each region. Two groups of speakers were asked to read the material composed twenty nine different Korean and English sentences and three times. 23 English sentences recording material was commonly used for the two groups, but six Korean sentences were different dependency on the groups, to represent the traits of the two dialects.
In the case of Korean sentences, F0(fundamental frequency) was measured all syllables in every sentence and examined the intonation of the initial and final. On the other hand, F0 was measures only extracted from the particular accentual phrases positions that were expected to show the intonation could be rise or fall in the English sentences. All the English sentences classified according to the types of the sentence; declarative, interrogative or imperative sentences and from this classification was considered in the analysis.
The significant differences were only followed at the end of the Korean declarative sentences, around the accentual syllables in the English yes-no interrogative sentences, and around the accentual syllables in the English wh-interrogative sentences. As a result, there was no meaningful differences in the intonation of English sentences. The reason is supposed to be have learned English since they were much younger that the ages of the speakers were produced by two dialect speakers relatively low and they have learned English since they were much younger.
